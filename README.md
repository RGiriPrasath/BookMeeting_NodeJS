Benefits of This Approach:
Declarative Configuration: Business rules are defined in a configuration file rather than hardcoded in the logic.

Extensibility: New conflict rules and suggestion strategies can be added without changing the core logic.

Separation of Concerns: The conflict detection and suggestion generation are separate from the controller logic.

Testability: Each rule and strategy can be tested independently.

Maintainability: When business requirements change, you only need to update the rules configuration.

Flexibility: The system can handle complex conflict scenarios by combining multiple rules and strategies.

Self-Documenting: Each rule and strategy has a description that explains its purpose.

Recursive Validation: Suggestions are validated to ensure they don't create new conflicts.
